LIST OF FEATURES (ALSO CONTAINS FEATURES THAT I WANTED TO ADD BUT DIDNT HAVE TIME TO COMPLETE)
Note: Some of these features are still a bit buggy and will be updated in the future

Tank Features: 
- It can be controlled by pressing the arrow keys or WASD, but cant get passed the border of the background
- It can shoot out bullets by pressing space and it will fly out based on a specific direction
- You can't shoot another bullet unless if the current bullet has not collided with anything
- It will get teleported back to 0, 0 if it touches the zombie

Zombie Features: 
- 10 Zombies will randomly spawn within the game screen, and it can overlap. (When you shoot a zombie, there is a change for 
																			  other dead zombies to randomly appear out of nowhere)
- Each zombie can move in a random direction within some time //(DIDNT FINISH)
- Once the bullet hits, it will be destroyed (Note: There is an issue where the game still thinks the zombie is still there 
												when you kill it and so you can still die if you collide on that part)

Other Features:
- There will be a timer shown in the top right and it will count up by minutes and seconds.
- There will be obstacles that will stop the bullet in its trajectory //(DIDNT COMPLETE)
